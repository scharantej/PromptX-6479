## **Flask Application Design**

**Problem:**

**Prompt:** Write a comprehensive summary of the article on large language models (LLMs) and user prompts. Include the key points and insights shared in the article, clearly outlining the specific strategies and tactics that users can employ to optimize their prompts and get better results from LLMs. Ensure that the summary is well-organized, easy to follow, and covers the following aspects:

1. Introduction: Begin with a brief overview of LLMs and their capabilities.
2. The Importance of User Prompts: Explain why user prompts are crucial for effective LLM performance.
3. Strategies for Effective Prompt Engineering: Elaborate on the six strategies for writing effective prompts, providing specific examples and use cases.
4. Tactics for Enhancing User Prompts: Provide a comprehensive list of tactics that users can implement to enhance the quality of their prompts, ensuring that they are clear, concise, and specific.
5. Examples of Prompt Variations: Demonstrate how users can apply the strategies and tactics to optimize prompts for different scenarios, showcasing the impact on LLM performance.
6. Additional Best Practices: Share any additional tips and best practices that can help users get the most out of LLMs.
7. Conclusion: Summarize the key takeaways and emphasize the importance of prompt engineering for maximizing LLM performance.

**Solution:**

**HTML Files:**

* **index.html:** This file will serve as the main page of the application. It will include a form for users to enter their prompts and a button to submit the prompts. The form will contain a text area for the prompt and a drop-down menu for selecting the type of LLM to use. The button will trigger the submission of the form, sending the prompt to the server for processing.
* **results.html:** This file will display the results of the LLM processing. It will include a text area for displaying the LLM's output and a button to return to the main page.

**Routes:**

* **index:** This route will handle the GET requests for the main page. It will render the index.html file.
* **results:** This route will handle the POST requests for submitting prompts. It will receive the prompt and the selected LLM type from the form data. The route will then process the prompt using the specified LLM and render the results.html file, displaying the LLM's output.
